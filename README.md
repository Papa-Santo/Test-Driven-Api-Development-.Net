This exercise is to develop an API with test driven development.

The test are written in Cypress. I plan on making a video to explain how to write the test code before the api code.

This also shows how to use entity framework to develop a database with foreign key relationships.

No true DTOs or validations were used. The controllers are allowed to interact with the database directly rather than through a data layer. Everything is checked in the controller to keep this focused on test driven development.

This same exercise is implemented in Nodejs/Express. It is not uploaded as of 9/12/2024. It will be uploaded soon as an example for Node devs.

Note: There are tests written to test the api strictly with Vitest and React Testing Library. It was significantly more difficult to set up. I do not recommend it.
