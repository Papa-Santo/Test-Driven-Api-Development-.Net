This exercise is to develop an API with test driven development.

The test are written in Cypress.

This also shows how to use entity framework to develop a database with foreign key relationships.

Validations are done in the controller to keep this focused on test driven development.

This same exercise is implemented in Nodejs/Express as an example to Node devs.

Note: There are tests written to test the api strictly with Vitest and React Testing Library. It was significantly more difficult to set up. I do not recommend it.
